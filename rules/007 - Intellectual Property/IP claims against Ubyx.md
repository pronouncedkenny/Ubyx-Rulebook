## Rule Overview

This rule sets the expectations for participant engagement in the Ubyx network and prohibits the assertion of patent infringement claims against Ubyx Inc., its affiliates, contractors, agents, and other network participants for activities arising from participation in the Ubyx clearing system.

## Obligations

**1. Obligation 1: Acceptance of Ubyx Network Framework**  
Participants acknowledge that Ubyx Inc. provides a technology platform, rulebook, and associated services to enable secure, lawful, and interoperable stablecoin redemption at scale. Participation in Ubyx provides access to these programs, products, and services as part of a common networked infrastructure.

**2. Obligation 2: No Assertion of Patent Claims**  
As a condition of participation in the Ubyx clearing system, each Participant agrees not to assert, and not to authorize, assist, or encourage others to assert, any patent infringement claim against Ubyx Inc., its affiliates, contractors, agents, service providers, or other participants in the Ubyx network, based on the use, development, operation, or implementation of any program, product, protocol, service, or technical component made available through or by Ubyx.

**3. Obligation 3: Continuity of Non-Assertion Obligation**  
This non-assertion obligation applies both during participation and thereafter, for any conduct relating to Ubyx programs and services that occurred while the Participant was active in the network.

## Non-Compliance Penalties

Violation of this non-assertion obligation may result in:

- Termination of participation rights in the Ubyx clearing system;  
- Legal action to enjoin the infringement claim and recover damages;  
- Reimbursement of legal costs incurred by Ubyx Inc. and affected participants;  
- Disclosure to relevant authorities or courts in applicable jurisdictions.
