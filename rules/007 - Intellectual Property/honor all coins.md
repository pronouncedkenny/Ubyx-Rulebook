---

## Rule Overview

This rule requires Receiving Institutions to accept all eligible stablecoins issued by Participants in the Ubyx clearing system, provided the coins are properly presented for redemption and do not violate compliance or risk standards. This ensures fungibility, neutrality, and universal acceptance across the network.

## Obligations

**1. Obligation 1: Acceptance of All Coins**  
Receiving Institutions must accept for redemption at par value all stablecoins issued by any regulated Issuer participating in the Ubyx clearing system, regardless of the issuerâ€™s identity, blockchain, or currency (subject to currency support limitations of the Receiving Institution).

**2. Obligation 2: Neutrality of Acceptance**  
Receiving Institutions must not refuse redemption of a stablecoin solely because:
- The issuer is a commercial competitor;
- The issuer is located in a different jurisdiction;
- The coin is denominated in a supported foreign currency;
- The stablecoin is held on a supported public blockchain other than the one preferred by the Receiving Institution.

**3. Obligation 3: Exceptions to Universal Acceptance**  
Receiving Institutions may decline to accept a stablecoin only under the following circumstances:
- The stablecoin fails local compliance checks (e.g. AML, sanctions, fraud risk);
- The Receiving Institution has not yet enabled redemption for the specific currency or blockchain;
- The issuer is no longer in good standing under Ubyx governance (e.g. suspended or terminated);
- The technical submission of the coin is not compliant with Ubyx message formats.

**4. Obligation 4: Non-Discriminatory Practices**  
Receiving Institutions may not prioritize, restrict, or steer end users away from accepting certain Ubyx-approved stablecoins, except as permitted above. Any preference-based steering must preserve user choice and comply with applicable law.

## Non-Compliance Penalties

Failure to honor all coins may result in:

- Formal breach notices and remediation requirements;  
- Public or network-level notice of non-compliance;  
- Temporary suspension from the Ubyx clearing system;  
- Permanent revocation of Receiving Institution status;
