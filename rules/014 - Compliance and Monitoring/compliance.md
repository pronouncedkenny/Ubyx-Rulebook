## Rule Overview

This rule establishes the legal and regulatory compliance obligations of participants in the Ubyx clearing system. It requires participants to operate in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and to ensure that their affiliates, agents, and connected entities also meet these standards.

## Obligations

**1. Obligation 1: General Legal Compliance**  
Each Participant must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, rules, and legal requirements in every jurisdiction in which it operates. This includes, but is not limited to, requirements concerning banking, payment systems, money transmission, foreign exchange, anti-money laundering (AML), counter-terrorist financing (CTF), sanctions compliance, consumer protection, privacy and data security, financial services, and intellectual property.

**2. Obligation 2: Third Party and Affiliate Compliance**  
Each Participant is responsible for ensuring that its affiliates, subsidiaries, parent entities, and any agents or third-party service providers (including hosted wallet providers and scaling partners) acting on its behalf or participating in the Ubyx system comply with the applicable legal and regulatory obligations in the jurisdictions in which they operate.

**3. Obligation 3: Legal Review and Monitoring**  
Each Participant is encouraged to seek independent legal advice as necessary and must implement internal processes to monitor and maintain compliance with applicable legal and regulatory obligations on a continuing basis.

**4. Obligation 4: Legality of Transactions**  
All transactions processed through the Ubyx clearing system must be lawful in the jurisdiction of the Sender and the Recipient (or Receiving Institution). Ubyx does not support or facilitate transactions that would be considered illegal in either jurisdiction.

**5. Obligation 5: Precedence of Law**  
In the event of any conflict between the Ubyx Rulebook and any applicable law or regulation, the applicable law or regulation shall prevail.

## Non-Compliance Penalties

Non-compliance with these obligations may result in:

- Written notices and mandatory remediation actions;  
- Financial penalties or service limitations;  
- Suspension or termination of participation in the Ubyx clearing system;  
- Disclosure to relevant regulatory or enforcement authorities;  
- Legal action for breach of contract or indemnification under applicable law.
