## Rule Overview

This rule prohibits Receiving Institutions from adding surcharges or supplemental fees to redemption transactions involving stablecoins submitted through the Ubyx clearing system. The goal is to preserve price transparency and eliminate discriminatory pricing for digital money acceptance.

## Obligations

**1. Obligation 1: No Redemption Surcharges**  
Receiving Institutions must not impose any additional fee, markup, or surcharge over and above the advertised or expected price in connection with the redemption of Ubyx-eligible stablecoins, unless explicitly required by applicable law or regulation.

**2. Obligation 2: All-Inclusive Pricing**  
If surcharges are permitted by law, any such charge must be transparently included in the total redemption transaction amount submitted through the Ubyx platform. Separate or off-ledger fee collection is prohibited.

**3. Obligation 3: Equal Treatment of Stablecoins**  
Receiving Institutions must not impose fees or surcharges that discriminate between stablecoin issuers, networks, or denominations. All accepted coins must be treated equally in pricing and redemption.

**4. Obligation 4: Disclosure Requirements**  
Where surcharges are legally allowed, the Receiving Institution must clearly disclose to the user the amount and basis of the surcharge prior to completing the redemption transaction.

## Non-Compliance Penalties

Violations of this rule may result in:

- Formal notice and mandated fee reversal procedures;  
- Temporary or permanent suspension from the Ubyx network;  
- Reputational sanctions or public notice of breach;
