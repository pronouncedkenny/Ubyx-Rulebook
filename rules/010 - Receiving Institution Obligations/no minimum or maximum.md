---

## Rule Overview

This rule prohibits Receiving Institutions from conditioning the acceptance of Ubyx-eligible stablecoin redemptions on any minimum or maximum transaction size. The aim is to ensure equal access to the Ubyx clearing system for all users, regardless of transaction value.

## Obligations

**1. Obligation 1: No Minimum Redemption Thresholds**  
Receiving Institutions must not impose a minimum transaction size as a condition for accepting stablecoins submitted for redemption via the Ubyx platform.

**2. Obligation 2: No Maximum Redemption Limits**  
Receiving Institutions must not set a maximum transaction threshold as a condition for processing redemptions, except where such limitations are explicitly required by applicable law or regulation (e.g. anti-money laundering rules, risk-based caps).

**3. Obligation 3: Equal Access to Redemption**  
All redemption requests that comply with the Ubyx technical message format, legal requirements, and financial crime screening must be accepted without discrimination based on transaction size.

**4. Obligation 4: Exceptions by Law or Regulatory Order**  
If a Receiving Institution is required by law, regulation, or court order to apply limits on redemption amounts, it must notify the Ubyx Association in writing and provide evidence of such mandate.

## Non-Compliance Penalties

Imposing prohibited transaction size limits may result in:

- Mandatory corrective action plans;
- Temporary or permanent suspension from the Ubyx clearing system;
- Financial penalties or reputational sanctions;
- Legal remedies under Ubyx governance procedures.
