---

## Rule Overview

This rule requires all Receiving Institutions participating in the Ubyx clearing system to provide customers with a clear and timely confirmation for every stablecoin deposit. This ensures user confidence, supports transaction transparency, and enables effective audit and dispute resolution.

## Obligations

**1. Obligation 1: Mandatory Confirmation**  
For every stablecoin deposit processed via Ubyx, the Receiving Institution must generate a customer-facing confirmation. This confirmation serves as a transaction receipt and must be provided immediately upon successful processing.

**2. Obligation 2: Delivery Method**  
The confirmation must be issued in a form appropriate to the channel used:
- For online or app-based deposits: an on-screen confirmation and an electronic message (email, SMS, or app notification).  
- For in-person deposits via ATM or branch: a printed receipt or paper transaction slip must be offered.

**3. Obligation 3: Required Information**  
Each transaction confirmation must include:
- Date and time of deposit;  
- Stablecoin type and amount received (e.g., “500 USDC”);  
- Fiat currency amount credited (e.g., “$500”);
- Foreign exchange rate applied, where applicable;  
- Transaction reference number (ideally a Ubyx network reference ID);  
- Optional: partial wallet address of sender (for customer clarity).

**4. Obligation 4: Internal Logging and Recordkeeping**  
Receiving Institutions must retain an internal record of each deposit, linked to both the customer’s account and the network transaction. This record must be maintained in accordance with Ubyx audit and reconciliation standards and be available for dispute resolution or regulatory inspection.

**5. Obligation 5: Uniform Standards**  
Ubyx Inc. may define and enforce standardized confirmation formats or transaction reference schemas to ensure consistency across participants. Participants must adopt such formats upon issuance.

## Non-Compliance Penalties

Failure to issue proper confirmations may result in:

- Mandated corrective actions or technical remediation;  
- Suspension from processing new deposit flows via Ubyx;  
- Increased oversight or audit obligations;  
- Reputational notice to affected counterparties or customers.
