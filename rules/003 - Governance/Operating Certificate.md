---

## Rule Overview

This rule governs the issuance and maintenance of Ubyx Operating Certificates, which serve as the formal instrument authorizing a participant to operate within the Ubyx clearing system. Certificates confirm the role, scope, and standing of each approved participant and are a condition for lawful system use.

## Obligations

**1. Obligation 1: Issuance of Operating Certificate**  
Ubyx Inc. will issue an Operating Certificate (also referred to as a membership license or confirmation) to each participant upon approval. The certificate will:
- Identify the participant by legal name and regulatory identifier;  
- Specify the approved role(s) (e.g. Issuer, Receiving Institution, Dual-role);  
- Indicate any geographic or jurisdictional limitations;  
- Confirm the date of issuance and, if applicable, expiration.

**2. Obligation 2: Requirement for Good Standing**  
Participants must maintain their certificate in good standing by:
- Continuing to meet eligibility and regulatory criteria;  
- Complying with the Ubyx Rulebook and any additional conditions specified in the certificate;  
- Responding to compliance reviews and audits;  
- Renewing the certificate if required under updated governance procedures.

**3. Obligation 3: Display and Representation**  
Participants may refer to their status as “Ubyx-certified” or a “Certified Ubyx Participant” only if their Operating Certificate is active and in good standing. Misrepresentation of status may result in revocation or enforcement action.

**4. Obligation 4: Suspension and Revocation**  
Ubyx Inc. may suspend or revoke an Operating Certificate in cases of:
- Non-compliance with the Rulebook;  
- Regulatory deterioration, insolvency, or fraud risk;  
- Breach of eligibility or good standing criteria;  
- Reputational harm or risk to system integrity.

During suspension or after revocation, the participant:
- May not conduct transactions through the Ubyx platform;  
- Must cease use of all Ubyx branding, interfaces, and technical connections;  
- May be required to reapply under full onboarding procedures.

**5. Obligation 5: Reinstatement**  
Participants may request reinstatement of a suspended certificate subject to remediation, audit clearance, or requalification. Reinstatement is discretionary and may be conditional or limited in scope.

## Non-Compliance Penalties

Operating without a valid Ubyx Operating Certificate, or continuing Ubyx-related activity after revocation, may result in:

- Immediate cessation orders;  
- Technical blocking of system access;  
- Legal action for unauthorized use;  
- Disclosure to other participants and regulators.
