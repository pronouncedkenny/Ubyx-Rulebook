## Rule Overview

This rule allows Ubyx Inc. to grant limited waivers from specific Rulebook obligations on a case-by-case basis. Waivers may be appropriate under operational, technical, transitional, or regulatory circumstances, but do not modify the Rulebook itself or set precedent.

## Obligations

**1. Obligation 1: Request Process**  
Participants may submit a formal request for a waiver from one or more Rulebook provisions. The request must include:
- A clear identification of the rule(s) in question;  
- The reason for the waiver (e.g. onboarding limitation, technical pilot, regulatory friction);  
- A proposed duration and any mitigating controls.

**2. Obligation 2: Evaluation and Approval**  
All waiver requests will be reviewed by Ubyx Inc. governance or executive management. Waivers will only be granted where:
- There is a valid and documented rationale;  
- Risk to the platform and other participants is low or adequately mitigated;  
- The waiver does not impair the integrity, neutrality, or regulatory posture of the Ubyx clearing system.

**3. Obligation 3: Conditions and Time Limits**  
Waivers, if granted, will typically:
- Be time-bound (e.g. 30â€“180 days);  
- Be subject to ongoing conditions or reporting obligations;  
- Include clear criteria for renewal, expiry, or revocation.

**4. Obligation 4: No Precedent or Implied Relief**  
The granting of a waiver to one participant does not imply or require similar treatment for others. All waivers are individual, non-transferable, and discretionary. No participant may assume a rule has been waived without explicit written confirmation from Ubyx Inc.

**5. Obligation 5: Revocation and Review**  
Ubyx Inc. may revoke or modify a previously granted waiver at any time if:
- Circumstances materially change;  
- The participant breaches the conditions of the waiver;  
- Continued waiver poses risk to the system or other users.

## Non-Compliance Penalties

Participants that operate in reliance on an assumed or expired waiver without written confirmation may be deemed in breach of the Rulebook and subject to:

- Immediate corrective directives;  
- Suspension or restriction of platform access;  
- Revocation of other existing waivers;  
- Reputational notice to other participants.
