An Issuer Cash Account is a designated, pre-funded fiat account maintained by a participating stablecoin issuer at a Ubyx-appointed Settlement Agent or Settlement Bank, held exclusively for the purpose of fulfilling redemption obligations arising under the Ubyx clearing system.

This account must be pre-funded in accordance with the minimum reserve requirements established by the Ubyx Rulebook, and must be denominated in the relevant fiat currency corresponding to the stablecoin issued.

The Issuer Cash Account serves as the source of funds for par-value redemptions requested by Receiving Institutions and operates under a ring-fenced arrangement that ensures full convertibility of participating stablecoins into fiat currency. Balances in the account may not be encumbered, pledged, or used for any purpose other than redemption settlement unless expressly permitted by the Rules.

Issuers must ensure that the account is continuously sufficient to meet anticipated net redemption flows, and acknowledge that failure to do so may result in return of redemption requests, enforcement action, or suspension from the Ubyx network.
