The Issuer Fee is a transaction-based fee that a participating stablecoin issuer is permitted to charge Receiving Institutions in consideration for the redemption of stablecoins at par value through the Ubyx clearing system.

The Issuer Fee is applied on a per-transaction basis and must be expressed as a percentage of the face value of the stablecoin being redeemed or as a fixed fee per redemption, as specified in the Ubyx schedule of fees. The Issuer Fee compensates the issuer for providing redemption liquidity and maintaining the operational infrastructure required to process redemption requests, including pre-funding and compliance obligations.

The Issuer Fee must be disclosed transparently to Receiving Institutions and may not be varied on a discriminatory basis between participants of equivalent status. The application, invoicing, and collection of Issuer Fees shall follow standardized procedures established by Ubyx and must be supported by appropriate reconciliation data and transaction-level detail.

No additional or hidden charges may be levied by the issuer beyond the disclosed Issuer Fee in connection with redemption activity processed through the Ubyx system.
