A Receiving Institution Cash Account is a designated fiat currency account maintained by a participating Receiving Institution at a Ubyx-appointed Settlement Agent, used exclusively to receive settlement proceeds from the redemption of stablecoins submitted through the Ubyx clearing system.

This account serves as the credit destination for funds disbursed by Issuers following successful redemption of stablecoins at par value. Upon verification and acceptance of a redemption request, the corresponding fiat amount is transferred from the Issuer’s pre-funded Cash Account into the Receiving Institution’s Cash Account, after which the Receiving Institution is obligated to credit the end user’s account in accordance with the Ubyx operational standards.

The Receiving Institution must ensure that this account is properly configured for real-time settlement operations, complies with the account structure and reconciliation requirements defined by Ubyx, and is not used for any other commercial, treasury, or proprietary purpose outside the scope of Ubyx-cleared transactions.

The Receiving Institution retains full responsibility for the safekeeping, accounting, and proper use of funds received into this account and must ensure that access, usage, and reporting comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and the Ubyx Rulebook.
