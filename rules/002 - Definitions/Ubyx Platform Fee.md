The Ubyx Platform Fee is a transaction-based fee, expressed in basis points, that is billed to the Receiving Institution for each successful redemption of stablecoins processed through the Ubyx clearing system.

This fee is calculated as a percentage of the face value of the redeemed stablecoin and is invoiced to the Receiving Institution on a periodic basis, in accordance with the billing and reconciliation procedures defined by Ubyx. The Platform Fee compensates Ubyx for providing the technical infrastructure, governance framework, and operational coordination that enable standardized, many-to-many stablecoin clearing.

The Ubyx Platform Fee is applicable only to redemptions that result in successful fiat settlement. It is separate from any fees charged by Issuers or Receiving Institutions for their own services and does not affect the amount credited to the end user.

Failure by a Receiving Institution to remit Ubyx Platform Fees in accordance with agreed payment terms may result in enforcement actions as defined in the Rulebook, including potential suspension from the Ubyx network.
