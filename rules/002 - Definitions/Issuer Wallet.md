An Issuer Redemption Wallet is a blockchain-based digital wallet maintained by a participating stablecoin issuer at the Ubyx-appointed Settlement Agent for the sole purpose of receiving and verifying stablecoin redemption submissions initiated by Receiving Institutions through the Ubyx clearing system.

Each Redemption Wallet must support all relevant stablecoin token contracts issued by the participating issuer across Ubyx-approved public blockchain networks. The Redemption Wallet functions as the institutional endpoint to which stablecoins are transferred by Receiving Institutions when customers request par-value conversion into fiat currency.

Upon receipt of stablecoins into the Redemption Wallet, the issuer must promptly conduct all required validation, compliance, and reconciliation procedures. Following successful verification, the issuer is obligated to release the corresponding fiat amount from its pre-funded Issuer Cash Account to the Receiving Institutionâ€™s account at the Settlement Agent.

The Redemption Wallet must be operated under secure, monitored conditions and remain under the legal and operational control of the issuer or a designated agent, in accordance with Ubyx security and operational standards. Use of the Redemption Wallet for any purpose other than clearing-system redemption is prohibited.
