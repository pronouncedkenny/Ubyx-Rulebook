The Ubyx Technical Platform is the secure, protocol-based infrastructure that enables the transmission of encrypted, structured instructions between participants in the Ubyx clearing system.

The platform serves as a messaging layer that facilitates the initiation, validation, and routing of stablecoin redemption requests. It connects directly to Issuers, Receiving Institutions, and Settlement Banks through mutually agreed, secure communication channels—such as encrypted APIs, message queues, or virtual private networks—ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation of all instructions.

Each message transmitted via the Ubyx Technical Platform follows a standardized schema and includes all required operational, compliance, and settlement data. This includes transmission of originator and beneficiary information necessary to comply with applicable Travel Rule obligations and other regulatory requirements.

Ubyx does not alter or interpret the content of messages, execute transactions, or take custody of assets. Its sole function is to relay authenticated and validated instructions between authorized parties in a secure and auditable manner.

The platform is continuously monitored and maintained in accordance with high standards of availability, reliability, and cybersecurity, and forms the core of Ubyx’s role as a neutral technical and rulebook provider.
