Ubyx is a stablecoin clearing system that provides a standardized technical layer and a common set of rules to enable the redemption of fiat-referenced stablecoins at par value between participating Issuers and Receiving Institutions.

Ubyx acts solely as a neutral infrastructure and governance provider. It facilitates interoperability through:

A secure, protocol-based platform that routes redemption instructions between participants; and

A Rulebook that defines participation criteria, operational standards, and settlement procedures.

Ubyx is not a principal to any transaction conducted within the system, and it does not act as:

A custodian of fiat or digital assets,

A money transmitter,

A payment processor, or

A stablecoin exchange.

Ubyx does not hold or process funds or digital assets on behalf of any party, and it does not provide services to end users or consumers. Its sole clients are regulated Issuers and Receiving Institutions that contract directly with each other and with Settlement Banks in accordance with applicable law.

By abstracting technical complexity and harmonizing operational standards, Ubyx enables many-to-many redemption across currencies, issuers, and blockchainsâ€”without centralizing risk or interfering with the underlying flow of assets.
