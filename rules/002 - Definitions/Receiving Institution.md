A Receiving Institution is a regulated financial entity, such as a bank, fintech, payment service provider, or e-money institution, that participates in the Ubyx clearing system for the purpose of receiving stablecoins on behalf of its clients and facilitating their redemption into fiat currency at par value.

To qualify as a Receiving Institution, the entity must:

Be authorized and supervised by a competent regulatory authority in its home jurisdiction;

Maintain a Receiving Institution Wallet and a Cash Account at a Ubyx-appointed Settlement Agent;

Satisfy the technical, operational, and compliance standards set forth in the Ubyx Rulebook; and

Agree to the Ubyx participation terms and conditions.

Receiving Institutions act as agents for their clients in receiving, verifying, and submitting stablecoin redemption requests. Upon successful redemption, they credit client accounts in fiat currency, either in the denomination of the stablecoin or in an alternative currency pursuant to client instructions and subject to applicable FX operations.

Receiving Institutions may impose their own fees, charges, and FX terms in accordance with their contractual arrangements with clients. They are solely responsible for the conduct of financial crime compliance checks, transaction monitoring, and regulatory reporting related to the stablecoin transactions they process.
