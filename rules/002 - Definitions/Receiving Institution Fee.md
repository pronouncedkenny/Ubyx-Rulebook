Receiving Institution Fees and Charges refer to any fees, commissions, foreign exchange margins, or other charges levied by a Receiving Institution in connection with the receipt, redemption, conversion, or onward crediting of stablecoin-related funds to its customers.

These fees and charges are determined solely at the discretion of the Receiving Institution and are governed exclusively by the terms and conditions agreed between the institution and its customer. Ubyx does not regulate, restrict, or assume any responsibility for the level, structure, disclosure, or application of such fees.

The Receiving Institution may, at its option, deduct such fees from the amount credited to the customer or apply them separately, provided that all such practices are lawful, transparent, and consistent with applicable regulatory requirements and the institutionâ€™s own contractual framework.

Ubyx operates on a gross settlement basis and does not interfere with the commercial relationship between Receiving Institutions and their clients.
