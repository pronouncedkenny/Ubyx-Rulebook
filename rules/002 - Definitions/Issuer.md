An Issuer is a regulated legal entity that is authorized to create and distribute fiat-referenced stablecoins and that participates in the Ubyx clearing system for the purpose of enabling the redemption of its stablecoins at par value through Receiving Institutions.

To qualify as an Issuer under the Ubyx Rules, the entity must:

Be subject to supervision by a competent regulatory authority in its jurisdiction;

Maintain sufficient reserves to support its stablecoin liabilities;

Comply with all applicable anti-money laundering (AML), counter-terrorist financing (CTF), and sanctions regulations; and

Enter into all necessary agreements required by the Ubyx system, including adherence to the Ubyx Rulebook.

An Issuer must maintain (i) a pre-funded fiat Cash Account at a designated Ubyx Settlement Agent and (ii) a Redemption Wallet capable of receiving and verifying stablecoin redemption requests via the Ubyx network. The Issuer is responsible for timely settlement of redemption obligations and for supporting operational transparency, transaction integrity, and compliance with applicable legal and technical standards.

Issuers may charge a standardized Issuer Fee for redemptions, but must not impose additional conditions or discriminatory practices that impede the uniform operation of the Ubyx system.
