A Hosted Wallet offered by a Receiving Institution within the Ubyx system refers to a digital wallet account, provisioned and controlled by a regulated financial institution or its designated technology partner, which enables the receipt, temporary holding, and processing of stablecoins on behalf of an end user, for the purpose of initiating redemption at par value into fiat currency via the Ubyx clearing mechanism.

Such wallets must support all Ubyx-permitted stablecoins across all relevant blockchain networks and must be capable of supporting the necessary compliance functions, including transaction monitoring, sanctions screening, and anti-money laundering controls. Hosted Wallets are non-custodial from the perspective of long-term storage: they serve as a pass-through mechanism to facilitate the redemption process and are not intended for indefinite safekeeping of digital assets unless explicitly authorized by the applicable Rule.

The Receiving Institution remains legally responsible for the operation, security, and compliance of Hosted Wallets, whether operated directly or through a Ubyx-approved Scaling Partner.
