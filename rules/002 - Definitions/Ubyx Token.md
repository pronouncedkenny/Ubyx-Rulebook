The Ubyx Token is a planned digital asset intended to support the future evolution of the Ubyx clearing system. It is not part of the current implementation of the Ubyx platform and has no operational role at present.

The Ubyx Token is envisioned as a utility token that may be used, in a future phase of the platformâ€™s development, to facilitate progressive decentralisation of the Ubyx network. Potential use cases include:

Participation in the governance and maintenance of the Ubyx Rulebook;

Payment of transaction fees within the Ubyx clearing system; and

Incentivisation of ecosystem participants contributing to network performance, security, or reach.

The design, issuance, and functionality of the Ubyx Token will be governed by a separate Ubyx Token Whitepaper, to be published at a later date. Any such development will be subject to applicable legal, regulatory, and technical standards and will not affect the rights or obligations of participants under the current Rulebook unless and until formally adopted.
