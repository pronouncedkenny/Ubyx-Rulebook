A Receiving Institution Wallet is a blockchain-based digital wallet maintained by a Receiving Institution at a Ubyx-appointed Settlement Bank or Settlement Agent, used exclusively for the receipt and processing of stablecoins deposited by end users for redemption through the Ubyx clearing system.

This wallet functions as the technical endpoint for inbound stablecoin transfers submitted by the Receiving Institution on behalf of its clients. Upon receipt of stablecoins into the Receiving Institution Wallet, the institution initiates a redemption request through Ubyx, triggering the routing of the tokens to the corresponding Issuer’s Redemption Wallet and settlement of fiat funds into the Receiving Institution’s Cash Account.

Each Receiving Institution Wallet must support all Ubyx-permitted stablecoins across the relevant public blockchains and must be maintained in accordance with the security, compliance, and operational requirements specified in the Ubyx Rulebook.

The wallet may be operated directly by the Receiving Institution or by an authorized Ubyx scaling partner acting under the institution’s control and regulatory oversight. The wallet must not be used for proprietary or unrelated digital asset activity and is subject to transaction monitoring and reconciliation protocols as mandated by Ubyx.
