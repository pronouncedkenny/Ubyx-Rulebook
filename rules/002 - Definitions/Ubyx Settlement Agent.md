A Ubyx Settlement Bank is a regulated financial institution appointed by Ubyx to provide settlement services in fiat currency to participants in the Ubyx clearing system. The Settlement Bank holds and administers the fiat Cash Accounts of both Issuers and Receiving Institutions for the purpose of processing redemption transactions at par value.

Each Issuer and Receiving Institution maintains a direct, bilateral relationship with the Settlement Bank, including the establishment of necessary account agreements, compliance procedures, and operational protocols. Ubyx does not act as an intermediary in these relationships and does not assume custody or control over any participant funds.

The Settlement Bank executes settlement transfers between participant accounts based on standardized instructions transmitted via the Ubyx platform. These instructions reflect the outcome of validated redemption requests, enabling fiat funds to move from the Issuer’s Cash Account to the Receiving Institution’s Cash Account in real time or near real time.

The Ubyx Settlement Bank must meet minimum regulatory, creditworthiness, and operational standards, and must be capable of providing secure, auditable, and continuous fiat settlement infrastructure in each supported currency.
