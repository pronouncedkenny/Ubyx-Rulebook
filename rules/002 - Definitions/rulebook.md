The Ubyx Rulebook is the comprehensive set of binding rules, standards, and obligations that govern participation in the Ubyx stablecoin clearing system. It constitutes a legally enforceable contract between Ubyx Inc. and each Participant and is a condition of access to and continued use of the Ubyx platform.

The Rulebook defines the rights and responsibilities of all categories of Participants—including Issuers, Receiving Institutions, and Settlement Banks—and establishes the operational, technical, compliance, and settlement framework within which all Participants must operate.

By executing a Participation Agreement or equivalent onboarding documentation, each Participant agrees to be bound by the Ubyx Rulebook in its entirety, including any amendments or supplements issued in accordance with its change control procedures.

The Rulebook has primacy over all other operational documents and governs the conduct of Participants in their use of the Ubyx system, including the resolution of disputes, enforcement of obligations, and application of penalties for non-compliance.
