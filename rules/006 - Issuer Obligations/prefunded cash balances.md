### Rule Overview
To ensure the smooth functioning of the Ubyx Network and mitigate the risk of redemption delays, all Issuers are required to hold pre-funded cash balances at the Ubyx Clearing Bank. These balances must be maintained at a level sufficient to cover at least five (5) days of average redemption activity through the system.

### Obligations
1. **Minimum Pre-Funded Balance:**
   - Issuers must maintain a pre-funded cash balance at the Ubyx Clearing Bank equal to at least five (5) days’ worth of their average daily redemption volume within the Ubyx Network.

2. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
   - It is the sole responsibility of the Issuer to monitor their pre-funded cash balances and ensure they remain at or above the required threshold.

3. **Redemption Suspension Threshold:**
   - If the pre-funded balance falls to a level equivalent to one (1) day’s worth of average daily redemptions, redemptions through the Ubyx Network will be automatically suspended until the balance is restored to the required level.

4. **Restoration of Services:**
   - Redemptions will resume immediately upon confirmation that the pre-funded balance has been replenished to meet or exceed the minimum five-day requirement.

### Non-Compliance Penalties
Non-compliance with these obligations may result in:
- Temporary suspension of redemptions until the required balance is restored.
- Notification to affected Participating Institutions of the redemption suspension for operational awareness.
