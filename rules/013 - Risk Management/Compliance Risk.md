## Rule Overview

This rule sets minimum standards for managing compliance risk across all Ubyx participants. It is essential that each participant operates in full accordance with applicable laws and regulations and maintains an internal compliance framework capable of detecting, preventing, and reporting violations.

## Obligations

**1. Obligation 1: Regulatory Compliance**  
Participants must maintain compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and supervisory requirements in each jurisdiction in which they operate. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Anti-money laundering (AML);  
- Counter-terrorist financing (CTF);  
- Economic and trade sanctions;  
- Stablecoin licensing or authorization requirements;  
- Consumer protection and data privacy laws.

**2. Obligation 2: Internal Compliance Program**  
Each participant must implement a formal compliance program, approved by its governing body, that includes:
- A designated compliance officer or function;  
- Policies and procedures for AML/CTF and sanctions screening;  
- Staff training and awareness;  
- Independent audits or reviews at regular intervals.

**3. Obligation 3: Transaction Monitoring and Screening**  
Participants must:
- Screen all redemption transactions against relevant sanctions lists and high-risk jurisdictions;  
- Monitor for suspicious behavior, including structuring, evasion tactics, or anomalous flow patterns;  
- File reports with appropriate authorities as required under local law.

**4. Obligation 4: Change in Legal or Regulatory Status**  
Participants must promptly notify Ubyx Inc. if they:
- Become subject to a regulatory enforcement action;  
- Lose a required license or authorization;  
- Are placed under special supervision or insolvency proceedings.

**5. Obligation 5: Ubyx Oversight**  
Ubyx Inc. may require periodic attestations of compliance, request supporting documentation, or conduct reviews in response to observed risks. Ubyx reserves the right to suspend or revoke participation where legal or regulatory non-compliance presents a network-wide risk.

## Non-Compliance Penalties

Failure to manage compliance risk may result in:

- Immediate suspension of access to the Ubyx platform;  
- Termination of the participantâ€™s Operating Certificate;  
- Reporting to relevant national regulators or law enforcement agencies;  
- Reputational damage and network-wide notification.
