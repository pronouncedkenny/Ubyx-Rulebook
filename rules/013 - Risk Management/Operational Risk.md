---

## Rule Overview

This rule sets the standards for operational risk management for all Ubyx participants. Operational resilience is critical to maintaining stability, trust, and transactional continuity across the clearing network. Each participant must proactively manage risk arising from processes, systems, personnel, and external dependencies.

## Obligations

**1. Obligation 1: Operational Risk Program**  
Each participant must implement and maintain an operational risk management program proportionate to its size, complexity, and role within the Ubyx ecosystem. The program must cover:
- Process risk (e.g. settlement delays, manual errors);  
- System and service reliability;  
- Internal control failures;  
- Dependency on third-party service providers;  
- Key person risk and organizational continuity.

**2. Obligation 2: Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery**  
Participants must have documented and tested business continuity and disaster recovery (BC/DR) plans to ensure that critical services—such as redemption processing and system connectivity—can be maintained or restored during major disruptions.

**3. Obligation 3: Capacity and Availability Management**  
Participants must ensure their systems have sufficient capacity to handle anticipated transaction volumes under normal and stressed conditions. Redemptions must be processed in a timely and reliable manner.

**4. Obligation 4: Third-Party Risk Oversight**  
Where participants outsource any part of their Ubyx-related obligations (e.g. wallet hosting, KYC, compliance), they remain fully responsible for performance and risk controls. Participants must:
- Conduct due diligence on service providers;  
- Monitor performance and security;  
- Retain the ability to switch providers if continuity is threatened.

**5. Obligation 5: Incident Notification and Coordination**  
Participants must immediately notify Ubyx Inc. of any operational incident that:
- Prevents normal redemption activity;  
- Interrupts secure access to the Ubyx network;  
- Risks cascading effects across other participants.

Participants must cooperate with Ubyx-led responses to operational events affecting the broader network.

**6. Obligation 6: Review and Testing**  
Operational risk frameworks must be reviewed at least annually. Business continuity and failover capabilities must be tested at a frequency consistent with the participant’s risk profile and industry norms.

## Non-Compliance Penalties

Failure to manage operational risk may result in:

- Formal remediation mandates;  
- Temporary access suspension until controls are restored;  
- Reputational notice to counterparties;  
- Ineligibility to expand roles within the Ubyx system (e.g. from Receiving Institution to Dual Participant).
