## Rule Overview

This rule obliges all Ubyx participants to avoid conduct that may damage the reputation, integrity, or public trust in the Ubyx network or the broader stablecoin ecosystem. Ubyx Inc. reserves the right to take protective measures against entities that pose reputational or structural risks to the system.

## Obligations

**1. Obligation 1: Duty to Uphold Network Integrity**  
All participants must conduct themselves in a manner that maintains and reinforces the trustworthiness, legality, and professionalism of the Ubyx clearing system. Participants must not engage in conduct that could undermine public confidence in Ubyx, its participants, or stablecoin redemptions more broadly.

**2. Obligation 2: Prohibited Conduct**  
Participants must not:
- Engage in fraud, misrepresentation, or deceptive conduct (e.g. false reserve disclosures by issuers);  
- Facilitate or knowingly tolerate illicit activity (e.g. money laundering, terrorist financing, sanctions evasion);  
- Enable high-risk sectors known to generate systemic reputational damage (e.g. scams, Ponzi schemes, or illegal gambling);  
- Conduct business in a manner that contradicts their stated regulatory commitments or puts the network in reputational jeopardy.

**3. Obligation 3: Incident Notification**  
Participants must promptly notify Ubyx Inc. if they become subject to:  
- Public scandals, data breaches, or regulatory enforcement;  
- Material adverse media exposure;  
- Legal claims or insolvency proceedings that may impact their fitness to participate in the network.

**4. Obligation 4: Cooperation with Remediation**  
Participants are expected to work collaboratively with Ubyx Inc. to address and mitigate any incident that may damage the network’s integrity or public trust. This may include issuing clarifications, taking disciplinary action against internal staff, or adopting enhanced compliance measures.

**5. Obligation 5: Ubyx Protective Measures**  
Ubyx Inc. may impose enhanced oversight, suspend, or terminate the participation of any entity whose conduct presents an unacceptable risk to network reputation, legal compliance, or financial stability. Such action may be taken preemptively and without prior breach if integrity risk is deemed material and credible.

## Non-Compliance Penalties

Failure to meet these obligations may result in:

- Formal warning and remediation plan;  
- Temporary restriction from network participation;  
- Revocation of the participant’s Operating Certificate;  
- Notification to other participants and relevant regulators;  
- Public disassociation by Ubyx to preserve systemic trust.
