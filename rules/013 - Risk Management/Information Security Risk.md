## Rule Overview

This rule defines the cybersecurity and information security requirements for all Ubyx participants. It reflects the shared responsibility to protect the Ubyx network from cyber threats, data compromise, and operational disruption. Strong security practices are critical to maintaining the stability, confidentiality, and trust of the Ubyx ecosystem.

## Obligations

**1. Obligation 1: Security Risk Awareness and Management**  
All participants must implement a risk-based information security program appropriate to the scale and sensitivity of their operations. The program must address:
- Identification and protection of critical assets (e.g. wallets, keys, credentials);  
- Detection of unauthorized access or malicious activity;  
- Incident response, business continuity, and disaster recovery;  
- Regular threat assessments and updates.

**2. Obligation 2: Endpoint and Credential Protection**  
Participants must secure all access points to the Ubyx platform, including APIs, interfaces, and hosted infrastructure. They must:
- Enforce strong authentication and access control;  
- Use secure key management systems;  
- Protect API keys and network certificates from compromise;  
- Rotate credentials as recommended by Ubyx.

**3. Obligation 3: Secure Software and Infrastructure Practices**  
Participants must:
- Apply security patches to critical systems without delay;  
- Monitor for known vulnerabilities in codebases and dependencies;  
- Avoid unsupported or end-of-life software in critical operations;  
- Implement appropriate segmentation between internal systems and Ubyx connectivity.

**4. Obligation 4: Incident Notification**  
Participants must notify Ubyx Inc. immediately upon discovery of any cybersecurity incident that may:
- Compromise the integrity or confidentiality of data transiting the Ubyx system;  
- Impact the participantâ€™s ability to process or settle transactions;  
- Present a threat to the wider network.

**5. Obligation 5: Ubyx Security Oversight and Collaboration**  
Ubyx Inc. will:
- Maintain its own robust security framework for platform operations;  
- Conduct regular internal and third-party security reviews;  
- Issue technical security requirements and threat alerts to participants;  
- Coordinate network-wide responses to high-severity incidents.

**6. Obligation 6: Prohibited Security Practices**  
It is strictly forbidden for any participant to:
- Attempt to probe, scan, or exploit vulnerabilities in Ubyx infrastructure;  
- Conduct denial-of-service attacks or stress testing against Ubyx systems;  
- Introduce unauthorized code, monitoring tools, or malware;  
- Store or transmit private keys through unsecured or unapproved mechanisms.

## Non-Compliance Penalties

Failure to meet cybersecurity obligations may result in:

- Immediate revocation of access credentials;  
- Suspension from the Ubyx platform pending security review;  
- Disclosure to affected counterparties and regulatory authorities;  
- Legal action to recover damages or prevent further harm.
