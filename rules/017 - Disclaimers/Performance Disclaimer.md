## Rule Overview

This rule makes clear that Ubyx Inc. acts as a platform and rulebook administrator and does not guarantee or assume liability for the performance, solvency, reliability, or conduct of any participant in the system or any blockchain used for settlement.

## Obligations

**1. Obligation 1: No Guarantee of Issuer or Receiving Institution Performance**  
Ubyx Inc. is not responsible for the conduct or performance of any Issuer or Receiving Institution in the Ubyx clearing system, including but not limited to their ability or willingness to fulfill redemption or funding obligations in a timely, accurate, or lawful manner.

**2. Obligation 2: No Responsibility for Subcontractors**  
Ubyx Inc. assumes no liability for any actions, omissions, or failures of third-party service providers, agents, or subcontractors engaged by Issuers or Receiving Institutions, including scaling partners, wallet providers, or compliance vendors.

**3. Obligation 3: No Warranty of Blockchain Performance**  
Ubyx Inc. makes no representation or warranty regarding the security, uptime, latency, finality, or transaction capacity of any supported blockchain network. Risks associated with the use of public blockchains, including network congestion, reorgs, or smart contract flaws, rest entirely with the parties transacting over them.

**4. Obligation 4: Participant Due Diligence**  
Each participant is solely responsible for conducting its own due diligence on its counterparties, subcontractors, and the public blockchains it elects to use within the parameters of Ubyx-supported infrastructure.

## Non-Compliance Penalties

This rule functions as a disclaimer of liability. Any participant that misrepresents Ubyx’s role or conveys to customers or partners that Ubyx Inc. guarantees performance may face:

- Formal warnings and corrective disclosures  
- Suspension or revocation of access to the Ubyx platform  
- Reputational sanctions or network-wide notice  
- Legal action for breach of representation or misuse of Ubyx branding
