## Rule Overview

This rule governs indemnification and liability within the Ubyx clearing system. Participants are responsible for their conduct and must indemnify Ubyx Inc. and, where applicable, other participants for losses or claims resulting from breaches of the Ubyx Rulebook or misconduct. Ubyx Inc. does not accept responsibility for indirect losses or for participant-originated failings.

## Obligations

**1. Obligation 1: Participant Indemnification of Ubyx**  
Each participant agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Ubyx Inc., its directors, officers, employees, and affiliates from and against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages, costs, fines, or expenses (including legal fees) that arise out of or relate to:
- The participant’s breach of the Ubyx Rulebook;  
- Regulatory non-compliance or enforcement action stemming from the participant’s conduct;  
- Any misconduct, negligence, fraud, or failure to perform obligations under the Ubyx system.

**2. Obligation 2: No Shift of Regulatory Burden**  
Participants may not shift liability for regulatory failures onto Ubyx Inc. or other participants. For example, a Receiving Institution that fails to perform required KYC or AML checks must absorb and indemnify against any resulting regulatory or legal action.

**3. Obligation 3: Third-Party Claims**  
If a third party (e.g., a stablecoin user or counterparty) brings a claim related to a transaction processed through Ubyx, the participant involved in the transaction is responsible for handling and resolving that claim. The participant must indemnify and shield Ubyx Inc. from involvement unless the claim directly results from Ubyx Inc.’s own proven failure to meet its obligations.

**4. Obligation 4: Limitation of Ubyx Liability**  
Ubyx Inc. is not liable to any participant for indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages, including but not limited to lost profits, business interruption, or reputational harm, even if Ubyx was advised of the possibility of such damages.

**5. Obligation 5: Direct Fault Limitation**  
To the extent Ubyx Inc. is found liable for direct damages, its liability shall be limited to the lesser of:  
(a) the actual documented loss caused directly by Ubyx Inc.'s failure, or  
(b) a cap determined by the participant’s annual Ubyx platform fee contribution.

## Non-Compliance Penalties

Participants who fail to fulfill their indemnification obligations may be subject to:

- Legal enforcement by Ubyx Inc. for recovery of losses;  
- Suspension or termination from the Ubyx clearing system;  
- Network-wide notice to other participants and counterparties;  
- Regulatory escalation where applicable.
