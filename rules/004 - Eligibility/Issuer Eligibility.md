## Rule Overview

This rule sets out the eligibility requirements for institutions acting as stablecoin issuers within the Ubyx clearing system. It ensures all issuers operate from credible jurisdictions under appropriate regulatory supervision and maintain sufficient capital, operational controls, and legal compliance.

## Obligations

**1. Obligation 1: Jurisdictional Eligibility**  
To participate as an issuer in the Ubyx clearing system, an entity must be legally incorporated and licensed in a jurisdiction deemed low risk by Ubyx Inc., based on recognized global standards for financial regulation, AML/CTF enforcement, and sovereign risk assessment.

**2. Obligation 2: Regulatory Authorization**  
Issuers must hold a current license from a competent national regulatory authority that specifically permits the issuance of fiat-referenced stablecoins or equivalent digital financial instruments.

**3. Obligation 3: Financial Solvency and Capital Adequacy**  
Issuers must maintain sufficient liquidity and capital reserves as required by their home regulator. Ubyx may impose additional minimum thresholds based on transaction volume, exposure, or systemic role within the network.

**4. Obligation 4: Compliance Infrastructure**  
Issuers must demonstrate adequate operational controls, including:
- A compliance program aligned with FATF recommendations
- Real-time sanctions screening
- Transaction monitoring and suspicious activity reporting
- Independent audit capability

**5. Obligation 5: Transparency of Backing**  
Issuers must publish attestations or audits of reserve assets supporting their stablecoin liabilities on a periodic basis, as specified by the Ubyx Rulebook.

**6. Obligation 6: Ubyx Approval**  
All issuers must be vetted and approved by Ubyx Inc. prior to onboarding. Ubyx reserves the right to reject or suspend any issuer that no longer meets eligibility criteria or poses material risk to the integrity of the clearing system.

## Non-Compliance Penalties

Non-compliance with issuer eligibility rules may result in:

- Suspension or revocation of Ubyx issuer status  
- Freezing or denial of redemption access via the Ubyx platform  
- Public disclosure of breach and notification to relevant regulators  
- Legal action under contractual indemnities
