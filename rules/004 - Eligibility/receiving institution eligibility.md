## Rule Overview

This rule defines the minimum legal, regulatory, and jurisdictional requirements for entities seeking to act as Receiving Institutions within the Ubyx clearing system. These standards ensure safe, lawful redemption channels and minimize systemic risk.

## Obligations

**1. Obligation 1: Regulatory Status**  
To participate as a Receiving Institution, an entity must be:
- A licensed bank or deposit-taking institution supervised by a competent national authority;  
- A regulated non-bank financial institution authorized to offer payment, e-money, or digital asset custody services; or  
- A cryptocurrency exchange or digital asset platform licensed or registered under a recognized regulatory regime.

**2. Obligation 2: Jurisdictional Restrictions**  
Receiving Institutions must be established and primarily operate in jurisdictions classified by Ubyx Inc. as low or medium AML risk. Institutions incorporated or controlled from high-risk jurisdictions (as determined by FATF lists, EU lists, or Ubyx internal risk assessments) are not eligible to participate.

**3. Obligation 3: Compliance Readiness**  
Eligible Receiving Institutions must demonstrate capacity to:
- Perform real-time sanctions screening  
- Implement AML and CTF controls in line with international standards  
- Conduct know-your-customer (KYC) procedures on all relevant customers  
- Maintain audit trails and cooperate with regulatory inquiries

**4. Obligation 4: Licensing Verification**  
Receiving Institutions must provide verifiable documentation of current licensure or regulatory registration before onboarding and at any time upon request by Ubyx Inc.

**5. Obligation 5: Ongoing Assessment**  
Ubyx Inc. reserves the right to conduct periodic reassessments of Receiving Institution eligibility. Institutions that fail to maintain required licenses, are subject to regulatory action, or fall below compliance standards may be suspended or removed from the network.

## Non-Compliance Penalties

Failure to meet or maintain eligibility may result in:

- Immediate suspension of participation rights  
- Freezing of active redemption flows  
- Public notice of removal from the Ubyx clearing system
