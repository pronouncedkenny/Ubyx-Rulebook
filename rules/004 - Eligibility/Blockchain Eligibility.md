---

## Rule Overview

This rule defines the framework by which Ubyx Inc. determines whether a public blockchain is eligible for integration into the Ubyx clearing system. The criteria are designed to promote openness and innovation while protecting participants from undue risk, misuse, or operational fragility.

## Obligations

**1. Obligation 1: Good Standing Requirement**  
Ubyx Inc. will only support public blockchains that are, in the judgment of Ubyx, in good standing. This includes the absence of credible evidence of systemic security failures, material governance breakdowns, or sustained loss of community and developer support.

**2. Obligation 2: Due Diligence Review**  
Prior to onboarding any blockchain, Ubyx Inc. will perform a due diligence review that may include:
- Evaluation of the protocol’s technical whitepaper and documentation;
- Public codebase auditability and recent development activity;
- Review of known vulnerabilities and patch history;
- Negative news scans for regulatory enforcement, known hacks, or exploit history;
- Consideration of validator/decentralization structure and consensus model.

**3. Obligation 3: Operational Compatibility**  
The blockchain must be technically compatible with the Ubyx receiving institution infrastructure. At a minimum, it must:
- Support finality or transaction finality within predictable bounds;
- Be supported by secure and scalable wallet infrastructure for institutional-grade custody;

**4. Obligation 4: Jurisdictional Neutrality**  
Blockchains operated predominantly by entities located in high-risk or sanctioned jurisdictions may be excluded unless mitigation measures are demonstrably effective and approved by Ubyx Inc.

**5. Obligation 5: Ongoing Review**  
Blockchains already supported by Ubyx may be subject to reassessment at any time. Support may be suspended or revoked if material concerns arise regarding network reliability, regulatory posture, or security incidents.

**6. Obligation 6: Community Input and Governance Adaptability**  
Ubyx encourages technical stakeholders, Receiving Institutions, and Issuers to propose support for new blockchains via a formal submission process. Over time, governance of blockchain eligibility may transition to the Ubyx DAO, subject to safe-guarded procedures that balance openness with platform integrity.

## Non-Compliance Penalties

None — this rule governs infrastructure inclusion criteria, not participant behavior. However, participants must not route transactions through unsupported chains, and doing so may result in:

- Rejection of transaction at the protocol layer  
- Invalidation of redemption requests  
- Possible compliance escalation for circumvention behavior
