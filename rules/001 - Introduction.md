## Introduction to the Ubyx Rulebook

The Ubyx Rulebook defines the foundational principles, obligations, and operational standards governing participation in the Ubyx stablecoin clearing system. These Rules are designed to promote trust, ensure interoperability, minimize systemic risk, and facilitate the universal redemption of stablecoins at par value through regulated financial institutions, including banks and regulated non-banks.

The Ubyx network enables a many-to-many model that connects stablecoin issuers with receiving institutions via a standardized, rule-based clearing system. These Rules establish a legally binding framework between Ubyx Inc., and each participating Member. All participants must adhere to the Rulebook as a condition of entry and continued operation within the Ubyx ecosystem.

The Ubyx Rules set forth the minimum mandatory requirements applicable to all network participants. They uphold the safety, integrity, and soundness of the Ubyx clearing system, support compliance with anti-money laundering (AML), counter-terrorist financing (CTF), sanctions, and fraud-prevention regulations, and ensure consistent operational behavior across the network.

These Rules define operational obligations necessary to support the trust mark, ensure seamless redemption at full value, and uphold the fact pattern necessary for accounting recognition of stablecoins as cash equivalents.

All participants in the Ubyx system, whether banks, non-bank financial institutions, fintechs, or regulated stablecoin issuers, must comply with the Ubyx Rulebook as a condition of participation. Non-compliance may result in penalties, suspension, or expulsion from the Ubyx network.

By agreeing to the Ubyx Rulebook, each Member affirms their commitment to building a global, interoperable, and resilient stablecoin acceptance network that enables general-purpose digital money and brings the benefits of public blockchain infrastructure into regulated financial contexts.
