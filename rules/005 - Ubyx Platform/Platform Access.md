## Rule Overview

This rule governs access to the Ubyx technical platform. Access is restricted to authorized participants acting within the scope of Ubyx’s stablecoin clearing system. The rule protects system integrity, prevents abuse, and ensures that access credentials are used only by approved members for lawful and intended purposes.

## Obligations

**1. Obligation 1: Authorized Use Only**  
Use of the Ubyx technical platform is strictly limited to participants that have been approved by Ubyx Inc. and hold a valid Operating Certificate. All access must be for legitimate stablecoin clearing activities as defined in the Ubyx Rulebook.

**2. Obligation 2: No Third-Party Access**  
Participants may not allow or enable any non-member, including affiliates, contractors, or service providers, to access or use the Ubyx network on their behalf unless those parties are explicitly approved by Ubyx Inc.

**3. Obligation 3: Credential Control**  
All access credentials—including but not limited to API keys, authentication tokens, and network certificates—are unique to the participant and non-transferable. Participants must implement robust internal controls to safeguard these credentials and prevent unauthorized use.

**4. Obligation 4: Permitted Activities**  
Participants may use the Ubyx system solely for the submission, verification, and processing of redemption and related structured transactions between Ubyx participants. Any other use—including routing of unrelated payments, third-party message traffic, or synthetic settlement flows—is strictly prohibited.

**5. Obligation 5: Adherence to Technical and Security Standards**  
Participants must comply at all times with Ubyx’s published technical specifications, security protocols, and connectivity standards. This includes requirements for message formatting, data integrity, cryptographic authentication, and endpoint protection.

**6. Obligation 6: Prohibited Uses**  
It is expressly forbidden to:
- Use the Ubyx platform for any unauthorized financial service or digital asset activity;  
- Conduct data scraping, traffic analysis, or blockchain mining via Ubyx infrastructure;  
- Introduce malicious code or conduct penetration attempts against the platform.

**7. Obligation 7: Enforcement**  
Ubyx Inc. may immediately suspend, restrict, or terminate a participant’s access to the platform if it determines that:
- The participant has used the platform for unauthorized purposes;  
- Credential integrity has been compromised;  
- System integrity, security, or stability is at risk.

## Non-Compliance Penalties

Violations of this rule may result in:

- Immediate suspension of access to Ubyx systems;  
- Revocation of the participant’s Operating Certificate;  
- Notification to counterparties and regulators;  
- Legal or technical action to protect network integrity.
